# Hospital Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the **Hospital Monitoring Dashboard**, a Power BI project designed to deliver actionable insights into hospital operations. It integrates data on patient admissions, staff, financials, and trends, presented through an interactive interface that supports healthcare decision-making.

## Objective
The project aims to leverage Power BI's capabilities to provide a centralized platform for real-time data analysis, enhancing operational efficiency, monitoring patient care quality, and identifying healthcare trends across various hospitals.

## Dashboard Highlights
- Showcases real-time stats including 3,854 admitted patients, 3,369 doctors, an average LOS of 16 days, and a total bill of $97.8M for 2024.
- Features interactive filters for year, hospital, and medical condition, with a focus on conditions like Obesity.
- Displays demographic insights via bar charts (e.g., patients by age and gender) and pie charts (e.g., admitted patients by LOS type).
- Highlights test result trends with 9.9% normal, 55.9% abnormal, and 34.2% inconclusive results.
- Breaks down treatment costs by LOS and admission type, with notable contributions from hospitals like Houston Methodist ($1.036M).

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data modeling, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Data Sources**: Aggregated hospital datasets (e.g., patient records, billing data).
- **Development Environment**: Power BI Desktop for design and Microsoft Power BI Service for deployment.
